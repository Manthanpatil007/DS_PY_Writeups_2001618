The goal is to create a model that can accurately predict the target variable by asking a series of questions about the input features. The following is a brief overview of the working of the decision tree algorithm:\n",

        "\n",
        "The data is split into subsets based on the values of the selected feature. Each subset is then treated as a separate node and the process is repeated recursively until a stopping criterion is met, such as reaching a minimum number of samples per leaf or a maximum depth of the tree.\n",
        "\n",
        "At each leaf node, the majority class of the samples in that node is used as the predicted class for new instances that fall into that leaf.\n",
        "\n",
        "The resulting decision tree can be used to predict the target variable for new instances by following the decision path from the root node to a leaf node.\n",
        "\n",
        "The decision tree algorithm is popular because it is easy to understand and interpret the resulting model. The tree structure can be visualized and the decision rules can be easily understood by non-technical users. However, the algorithm may suffer from overfitting, where the tree becomes too complex and fits the training data too closely, leading to poor generalization performance on new data. Various techniques, such as pruning and limiting the tree depth, can be used to prevent overfitting and improve the performance of the model."
